    "description": "App for recording your moods by doing a \"check-in\" from time to time. This is a portfolio project for Louie Christie (https://www.louiechristie.com/) to demonstrate front-end coding with React Native, Expo, React Native Paper and Formidable Victory Charts.\n\n⚠️ Note: Moods saved in the app are ephemeral and will disappear from time to time. Much like moods in real life ⛅. (The back-end is mocked, and not implemented.)",
